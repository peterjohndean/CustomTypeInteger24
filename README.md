#  Custom Type Int24/UInt24

## 0. Preface
I am not a computer scientist, nor am I a professional programmer. I am just a hobbyist who likes to learn programming.
I am writing this post to share my learning with others. I am open to feedback and suggestions. Please feel free to provide your feedback.
I will try to incorporate it in my future posts.

## 1. Objectives

1. Understand how to implement a custom type in Swift.
2. Initially we will have the basics, to just hold/retrieve the value and initialize it.
3. Later we will add more functionality to it.

## 2. Introduction
In this post, we will learn how to create a custom type in Swift. We will create a custom type called `Int24` and `UInt24`. 
These types will be able to hold 24-bit signed and unsigned integers respectively. 
We will start with the basics and later add more functionality to it.
